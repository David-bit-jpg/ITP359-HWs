# USC ITP359 Applied Neural Networks HWs

Welcome to my repository showcasing the homework assignments from the USC ITP359 Applied Neural Networks course. In this course, I have delved into the fundamentals of neural networks and have hands-on experience with various advanced concepts. Through completing these assignments, I have gained a solid understanding of different types of neural network architectures, including Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)ï¼Œ etc. These projects reflect my journey through learning how to implement, train, and optimize neural networks to solve diverse and complex problems.
